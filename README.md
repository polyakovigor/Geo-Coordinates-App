# Geo-Location-App

###Simple **rails-app** which allows a user to enter their address and then returns the geo coordinates of the address location. 
On the start page 
You can create a new location by entering _address_, for example “St Pancras Station, London”. After that you can see that the location was successfully created: latitude and longitude are displayed on the page. 

Under the map you can see the nearby locations if there are such.
